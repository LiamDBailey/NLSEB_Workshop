# Introduction

This is a repository to accompany the workshop "Storytelling with Data: An academic perspective". In this workshop I will introduce the idea of Storytelling with Data, from [the work of Cole Knaflic](https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/books), and discuss how these ideas might be applied to the work of academics. The workshop will be split across 2 sessions, each 1hr 10min. A short summary of the topics we will cover is outlined below.

# Using this repository

The repository contains all the materials used the run the workshop. The contents are described below.

- /data: .csv files used to create plotting examples. Files labelled `practice_example` are used for the practice data visualization tasks at the end of the workshop.

- /plots: All the plots used in the workshop slides.

- /scripts: Contains a .Rmd file `plot_code.Rmd` that shows the raw code used to create all plots, with some explanation. This report is also knitted to .html format for easier viewing.

- /slides: All Powerpoint slides used in the workshop are included in `NLSEB_slides.zip`

# The sessions

## Session 1:

- Introduce the idea of Storytelling with Data. What does this mean and why might it be useful for academics?

- A step-by-step example using the concepts of Storytelling with Data to improve a data visualization. We will remove clutter, focus attention, and make the plot accessible.

- Open discussion. For the remainder of the session we will talk about how these approaches could be applied to academic data visualization.

## Session 2:

- A brief guide to {ggplot2} and friends. Introduce the {ggplot2} plotting library for R and give a few tips on how this library can be used to achieve data visualization.

- Choosing the right plots for your visual. We will discuss the main types of plots you will need to achieve most data visualization and talk briefly about how they can be achieved in {ggplot2}.

- Practical example. Finally, participants will get to put their skills to the test. Groups will be given examples of poor data visualization and asked to use what they've learnt to make them better. Groups should think purposefully about the changes and make and explain their decisions to the rest of the participants.
